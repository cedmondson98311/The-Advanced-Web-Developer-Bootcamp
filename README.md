# The-Advanced-Web-Developer-Bootcamp
My projects that I completed while taking The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. This is a full-stack web development course that covers React 16, Redux, D3, ES2015, Testing, CSS Flexbox, Animations, SVG, AJAX, and more.

## Description

This complete course teaches the latest technologies, tools, and libraries needed to become a proficient web developer. This course is taught by professional bootcamp instructors. The material learned in this course has been taught to hundreds of students in person and thousands online. During this course the student will build over 10 projects and have dozens of code challenges presented to them to ensure that the material is understood.
